# Locus.ai

![Logo](/frontend/images/logo_3.png)

Locus.ai is a web application for everyone, from an aspiring artist or an author who seeks inspiration to a game master in a good old RPG game. Locus.ai utilizes OpenAI GPT-3 and StableDiffusion. All you have to do to get started is to input a story. Locus.ai will return a list of concept images for your story. One of these images could be a character in that story or a scene. The limit is your imagination and what story you provide. No data is collected from your story either, so you can use it with peace of mind.
